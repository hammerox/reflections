How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

'diff' gives you the lines that are different between two files, so you can compare two versions without having to read the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can quickly run through the timeline of you file, giving access even to commands that were deleted in previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You can select whether a change is important enough without having to worry with unnecessary information being commited.
Cons: You are suceptible to human mistakes.
